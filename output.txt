8.2 Water uptake

    (b) Aphids have been used to investigate the translocation of sucrose in phloem tissue. While  they are feeding on phloem sap aphids excrete a sucrose‑rich fluid known as honeydew.   In an investigation, two groups of four aphids were placed at intervals along the stem of a  young willow plant, as shown in Fig. 3.2. group A damp cotton wool Petri dish with water Petri dishes for collecting honeydewglass chamber filled with carbon dioxide gas containing  14 C group B Fig. 3.2   The leaves were enclosed in an airtight glass chamber. A special form of carbon dioxide gas  that contained radioactive carbon‑14 ( 14 C) was supplied to the leaves for a short period of  time.   Samples of honeydew were collected at intervals from the groups of aphids. The time taken  for sucrose containing  14 C to travel the distance between group A and group B was recorded.   The investigation was repeated twice using a fresh stem and different groups of aphids for  each trial. The results are shown in Table 3.1.

    (b) One problem with using biomass in the process shown in Fig. 4.1 is that the breakdown stage  produces a sugar called xylose and ethanoic acid. Yeast cannot use xylose, and ethanoic  acid is toxic to yeast.   Scientists genetically engineered a type of yeast that can use xylose and ethanoic acid.
